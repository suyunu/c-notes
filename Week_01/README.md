## Installation

The installation consists of four stages. The steps you should follow for these stages are OS dependent (Windows, Linux, MacOS). 

* **Stage #0:** https://programming.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/
* **Stage #1:** *Install Java 8u181 JDK*
* **Stage #2:** *Installing the C Compiler*
* **Stage #3:** *Download and Install the ZIP File*
* **Stage #4:** *Run Eclipse and Set Your Workspace*



## Eclipse IDE

### What's an IDE? 

An integrated development environment (**IDE**) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An **IDE** normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. (Definition from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)

### Eclipse is an open source integrated development environment. 

It provides tools for *writing code, compiling and building the program and debugging.*



## User Interface

### Creating a New Project and Running

* Click **New** Under **File**.
* Choose **C/C++ Project**. 
* Choose **C Managed Builds**. 
* Give your project a *name* and click **Finish**. 
* To build and run your project for the first time, you should right click on the project on *Project Explorer*. 
* Click **Build Project** from the options.
* After you see *Build Finished* message on the *Console*, right click on the project again. 
* Click **Run as Local C/C++ Application**.  
* After first building and running, you could use the **build** and **run** buttons on the *Toolbar*. 

## Main Function 

* This function is "called" by the operating system when the program runs. Thus it is the first code executed when a program starts. 
* Statements are executed in sequential order.

* **return 0;**  terminates the main() function and returns the value 0 meaning that the program runned successfully.

## Comments

* Multiline comments: /* */

* Single line comments:  //

## Code Block 

* The set of statements between a pair of braces is called a *block*.

* Each statement must end with a semicolon (;)

## Variables

* Storing value for later use
* Variable names: only letters (English), digits, and underscore ( _ ). cannot start with a digit. Case sensitive.

## Declarations

* In C, every variable needs to be *declared* to be a specific type before use. (i.e. int sum;)
* Several variables of the same type can be declared in a single line. Names separated with comma. (int num1, num2, num3;)

## Assignments (=)

* Stores a value at the memory location reserved for the variable. **Not mathematical equality.**

## Operations 

* Sum, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus. 

## Conventions

* Write one statement per line
* Indent the code inside a block (press Tab).
* Blocks inside blocks should be further indented.
* Use spaces on both sides of operators.
* Use a lot of comments.
* Use meaningful variable names.

## Output

* The #include directive copies the contents of a “header file” into source code.
* stdio.h: The header file for the standard input-output library.
* Required for the printf() function.
* #include <stdio.h>

### printf() 

* printf(“Result= %d\n”, number_3);
* Takes a “format string”, and any number of expressions. Expression: Anything that returns a value.
* %d: “Format specifier”, used for int.
* \n: Newline character (one of the “escape” characters)
* printf(“%d + %d = %d\n”, number_1, number_2, number_3);**
